### About me
I'm passionate about software engineering, data science, robotics, and emerging technologies. With a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Mathematics with a Data Science Concentration, I have expertise in designing APIs, developing serverless solutions, and solving challenging problems using AI and machine learning frameworks like Sci-kit Learn, TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch.

Iâ€™ve worked extensively with programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, and C/C++, applying them across domains like web development, machine learning, and robotics. My projects range from creating chatbots with advanced reasoning to building a fully functional robot car, and I'm always eager to explore innovative ideas and push the boundaries of technology.
